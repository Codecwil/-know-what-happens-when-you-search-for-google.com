Ever wondered what really happens behind the scenes when you hit that ENTER button after typing a search query like "Google.com"? ðŸ¤” Well, buckle up because I'm about to take you on a fascinating journey through the inner workings of the internet!


1-DNS Resolution: The user's device initiates a DNS lookup to translate the domain name "google.com" into an IP address. This can involve querying local DNS servers or recursive DNS servers provided by the ISP.

2-TLS Handshake: If the user's browser supports HTTPS (HTTP over TLS), it initiates a TLS handshake with the server at the resolved IP address. This involves negotiating encryption parameters and exchanging cryptographic keys to establish a secure connection.

3-Server Authentication: During the TLS handshake, the server presents its SSL/TLS certificate, which contains its public key and other identifying information. The browser verifies the certificate's authenticity to ensure it is issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA) and that the domain name matches.

4-Secure Data Transmission: Once the TLS connection is established, all data exchanged between the user's browser and the server is encrypted to protect it from eavesdropping or tampering.

5-HTTP Request: The user's browser sends an HTTPS request to the server, including the domain name "google.com" and any additional parameters.

6-Server Processing: The server receives the HTTPS request, processes it, and generates an HTTPS response. This may involve querying databases, executing scripts, or accessing cached content.

7-HTTPS Response: The server sends back an HTTPS response containing the requested web page or resource, along with additional HTTP headers and possibly cookies for session management.

8-Page Rendering: The user's browser receives the HTTPS response and begins rendering the web page, interpreting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the content securely.

9-Secure Communication: Any subsequent interactions between the user's browser and the server, such as loading additional resources or submitting forms, also occur over the established HTTPS connection, maintaining data security and privacy.

And there you have it! The fascinating journey that happens every time you search for something online. Pretty cool, right?
Guys, I hope I was clear on these steps. Of course, feel free to add your opinion in the comment. 

 To make it easy to grasp, I've created a simplified step-by-step diagram of the procedure.
